Hello,

This is the github of reido113.

I have done some version control in the past, however, I have hardley implemented it into my personal workflow.

Here in this repo, I will attempt to excercise version control unto my personal projects. Fingers Crossed this will turn out well.

To note: I will try to limit the use of this repo to Linux projects.

Cheers,

Reid
